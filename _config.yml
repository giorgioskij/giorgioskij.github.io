  Hi! I'm Giorgio. I am a second year PhD student at Sapienza, in Rome, at the [Gladia lab](https://gladia.di.uniroma1.it/) under supervision of prof. Emanuele Rodolà.   

  After dark, I am a passionate music maker and listener, lover of photogaraphy and experimental art.

  I love logic a bit too much, reverse engineering, solving problems and putting
  my skills to the test whenever I can.

      At the moment, my research is focused on:
      - Audio generative models, with special focus on controllability, conditioning sources and strategies, and representation learning for audio;
      - Optimization and training dynamics of large models in continual learning;
      - Quantization of transformer models.

          Tripod is a small and portable, fully-convolutional deep 
          learning model to sharpen and correct the focus of real-world photographs.

          A physically based volumetric path tracer written in Julia from scratch 
          with my friend and colleague Antonio Gargiulo. It is 
          inspired from [Yocto/GL](https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl), the
          rendering engine developed by our professor, Fabio Pellacini. 
          It renders complex 3D scenes accurately, with almost negligible slowdown
          compared to a fairly optimized equivalently capable C++ implementation.

          This is a re-implementation, with more experiments, and extended to
          different videogame environments of the paper [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io/).

        title: NLP - Coreference resolution

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          During my NLP course, held by Roberto Navigli, I
          tackled the challenge of [GAP-coreference](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/gap-coreference),
          achieving results very close to state-of-the-art with a distilled transformer
          that could fit in 8GB of VRAM.

          A transformer-free approach to named entity resolution, using bidirectional
          LSTMs on different type of non-contextualized embeddings (W2V, Glove), 
          improved with character embedding and a Conditional Random Field (CRF).

          An implementation from scratch (...meaning from vanilla pytorch) of the 
          Double Deep Q Learning algorithm, applied to the classic first ever 
          Super Mario Bros videogame for the NES.

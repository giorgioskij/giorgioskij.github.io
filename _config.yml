  My name is Giorgio Strano.   
  I was born and currently live in Rome, Italy, where I study Computer Science at Sapienza University.  

  If I had lived in the 1300s I would have spent my life trying to understand how
  things worked. Unfortunately now solving string theory or P vs NP is out of my
  league, so the next best thing is teaching computers how to comprehend things
  that we possibly never could.

  I love logic a bit too much, reverse engineering, solving problems and putting
  my skills to the test whenever I can.

      After completing with honors my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Sapienza in 2021,
      I continued with a Master's degree especially focused on theoretical
      computer science and artificial intelligence, with a particular interest in Deep Learning.  

      As of June 2023, I am taking my last few exams, and I intend to spend the 
      next academic year working on my Master's thesis.

      Some of the topics that I have recently studied and I found extremely fascinating include:
      - Multimodal deep learning, with particular interest on latent space analysis and interpretation, fully convolutional architectures, VQ-VAEs, diffusion models and transformers
      - Advanced algorithms
      - Graph theory
      - Intensive computation and quantum computing
      - Natural language processing
      - Computer graphics, especially physically based volumetric path-tracing

      Follows a list of some of my favorite projects from the last couple of years,
      with a brief description.
      Code, results, and other (less interesting) projects are on my GitHub.

          Still a work in progress, Tripod will be a small and portable deep 
          learning model to sharpen and correct the focus of real-world photographs.

          A physically based volumetric path tracer written in Julia from scratch 
          with my friend and colleague Antonio Gargiulo. It is 
          inspired from [Yocto/GL](https://github.com/xelatihy/yocto-gl), the
          rendering engine developed by our professor, Fabio Pellacini. 
          It renders complex 3D scenes accurately, with almost negligible slowdown
          compared to a fairly optimized equivalently capable C++ implementation.

        link: https://github.com/giorgioskij/world-models
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          This is a re-implementation, with more experiments, and an extension to
          different videogame environments of the paper [World Models](https://worldmodels.github.io/).

        title: NLP - Coreference resolution
        link: https://github.com/giorgioskij/NLP-coreference-resolution
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          For my third homework of the NLP course, held by Roberto Navigli, I
          tackled the challenge of [GAP-coreference](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/gap-coreference),
          achieving results very close to state-of-the-art with a distilled transformer
          that could fit in 8GB of VRAM.

        link: https://github.com/giorgioskij/NLP-Named-Entity-Recognition
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          A transformer-free approach to named entity resolution, using bidirectional
          LSTMs on different type of non-contextualized embeddings (W2V, Glove), 
          improved with character embedding and a Conditional Random Field (CRF).

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          An implementation from scratch (...meaning from vanilla pytorch) of the 
          Double Deep Q Learning algorithm, applied to the classic first ever 
          Super Mario Bros videogame for the NES.

          For my Bachelor's thesis I devloped this project with the [Vision Lab](https://visionlab.di.uniroma1.it/)
          of Sapienza: Adaptive Neural Networks Via Reinforcement Learning.
          It explores the idea of networks able to automatically resize during 
          training to maximize the efficiency of crucial neurons and reduce the 
          overhead of inactive ones, achieving automatic in-itinere pruning and extension
          of networks based on the complexity of the task.
